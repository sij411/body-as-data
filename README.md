# Project introduction

It's a website that displays raw Base64 data in parts. You can take a photo using the webcam and check how the photo is shaped. This demonstrates how the computer perceives you—as sequences of mixed strings and integers. Body as data.

What would be included:

(It was springboot&Vaadin combo project, but I changed them to these)
