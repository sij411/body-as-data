# Project introduction

It's a website that displays raw Base64 data in parts. You can take a photo using the webcam and check how the photo is shaped. This demonstrates how the computer perceives youâ€”as sequences of mixed strings and integers. Body as data. 

# Yapping about projects

I will post some details on my blog soon.

What would be included:
- What I struggled
- What I considered
- My attitudes towards clients and etc
- Why Chrominum couldn't detect my webcam?

# Teck stacks

JavaScript/TypeScript, Next.js, HTML/CSS

(It was springboot&Vaadin combo project, but I changed them to these)
